Once upon a time, in a cozy little kitchen, a happy apple pie sat fresh out of the oven, smelling of cinnamon and sugar.

"Yum! I can t wait to be eaten!" the pie thought.

But just as the baker turned away, a curious breeze blew through the window… and whoosh! The pie rolled right off the table!

"Whee!" laughed the pie as it tumbled into the garden, where a squirrel sniffed it and a bird pecked a tiny crumb.

"Oh no! I’m meant for a little boy or girl!" the pie worried.

Luckily, the baker came running outside, scooped up the pie, and—just in time—placed it on a plate.

And that’s how the little apple pie made it safely… into the happiest belly in town!

The End.
